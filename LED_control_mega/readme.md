# About

This code is written for controlling Adafruit 64x32 LED matrix. 

# Usage

You need to download the following libraries first: [RGB Matrix Panel library](https://github.com/adafruit/RGB-matrix-Panel) (this contains the low-level code specific to this device), then the [Adafruit GFX Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) (which handles graphics operations common to many displays we carry) and [Adafruit BusIO](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO).  And include:

```c++
#include <RGBmatrixPanel.h>
```
