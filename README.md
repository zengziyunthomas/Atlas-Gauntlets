# Sensor Glove Controlled LED Matrix

## ABSTRACT
In this project we built a sensor glove which could read the gesture and the movement of the hand. Then to dig more about how it could be applied in daily life, we connected it to a LED matrix board to enable us to control the behavior of the LED matrix. Up to now we designed and implemented three modes for it. They are “Cursor”, “Writing”, “Printing” respectively with different functionality. The “Cursor” mode means we can control the movement of a cursor on the LED board with respect to the movement of the hand. The “Writing” mode means that we can write locus on the board, and based on the gesture, we can also erase the writings out. The “Print” mode means that the board can print different slogans based on different gestures of the hand.
